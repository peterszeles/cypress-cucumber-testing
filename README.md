## Develop a Gherkin command 💻
Use any JavaScript file in test/common folder as a template
```javascript
import {Given, When, Then, And} from "cypress-cucumber-preprocessor/steps";

Given(`Expression {string}`, (str) => {
    /** Here goes the implementation of the Gherkin command
     * Use the Cypress documentation for implementing the test.
     * @str is the variable from inside the Expression. 
     *      You can use STRING or NUMBER
     *      as many as it is **/ 
    
});

When(`Expression {string}`, (str) => {
    /** Here goes the implementation of the Gherkin command
     * Use the Cypress documentation for implementing the test.
     * @str is the variable from inside the Expression.
     *      You can use STRING or NUMBER
     *      as many as it is **/

});

Then(`Expression {string}`, (str) => {
    /** Here goes the implementation of the Gherkin command
     * Use the Cypress documentation for implementing the test.
     * @str is the variable from inside the Expression.
     *      You can use STRING or NUMBER
     *      as many as it is **/

});

And(`Expression {string}`, (str) => {
    /** Here goes the implementation of the Gherkin command
     * Use the Cypress documentation for implementing the test.
     * @str is the variable from inside the Expression.
     *      You can use STRING or NUMBER
     *      as many as it is **/

});


```

## Usage ⚙️
Create a new folder at folder tests/common which describes the testing domain.
Inside in this new folder create a Gherkin file type .feature
```gherkin
@custom-tag
  # The NAME of the feature testing file  
  Feature: The name of the feature

    # The description   
    Here goes the description

  # First scenario
    Given I am on "https://github.com/peterszeles/cypress-cucumber-testing" page
    When I click on "Go to file"
    Then I click on "cypress/fixtures/example.json"
    
  # Second scenario
  Scenario: Another scenario
    Given I am on "https://github.com/peterszeles/cypress-cucumber-testing/blob/master/cypress/fixtures/example.json" page
    Then I see "cypress-cucumber-testing" on the page

```

## Google Sheets format 🗄
To use Google Sheets for implementig test scenarios
- create a developer google site
- cleate a google sheet
- add your developer specific email
- use the sheets/snippet.js file to run
```bash
node sheets/snippet.js
```
